Backend:
- **Authentication**: Firebase [Auth](https://firebase.google.com/products/auth)

# Status

The platform runs, is currently serving hundreds of users, and hasn't had any downtime since it went live.

I'll continue to make minor updates as time goes on, but this is a essentially a maintenance project until I get some time and some bigger feature requests.
